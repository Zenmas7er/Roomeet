# Roomeet

Roomeet is a whiteboard application built in Python.
As of 5/27/2020, the app is currently capable of drawing onto
a blank canvas. The color and the size of the penstroke can be
changed, and a snapshot of the whiteboard can be downloaded as a
.png file.

## Installation

For non-developer use, the only necessary step for installation is to
download the GitHub repository.

For developer use, both [Python 3.7.4 or later](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-374/) and the 
[Kivy 1.11.1 library](https://kivy.org/#download) is required for modifying the Roomeet app.
You need to have Python downloaded before you download Kivy.

## Roadmap

Features planned for the future include:
- Comments... Yes really...
- A used color palette to compliment the color wheel
- An editable text box
- Image cropping
- Draw shapes
- Shape selection
